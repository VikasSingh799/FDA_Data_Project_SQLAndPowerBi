# Drug Approval Trends Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes drug approval trends from 1939 to 2016. The analysis explores yearly approval trends, segmentation patterns based on MarketingStatus, product categorization by dosage form, and therapeutic class trends.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- Drug approvals by year
- Sponsors and their approval counts
- MarketingStatus segmentation
- Dosage form distribution
- Therapeutic evaluation codes (TE_Code)

## Key Findings

### Task 01: Identifying Approval Trends
- The first recorded drug approvals were in 1939 (12 approvals), while the last year analyzed was 2016 (2,339 approvals).
- The highest drug approvals were in 2002 (5,661), and the lowest in 1945 (5 approvals).
- The top 3 years with the highest approvals: **2002, 2000, and 1996**.
- The top 3 years with the lowest approvals: **1945, 1943, and 1941**.
- **Top sponsors between 1939 and 1960:**
  - LEDERLE: 13 approvals
  - KING PHARMA: 11, 10, & 9 approvals
  - Many sponsors had only 1 approval.

### Task 02: Segmentation Analysis Based on MarketingStatus
- Products were grouped based on their MarketingStatus, with detailed insights available in tables.
- The total number of applications for each MarketingStatus after 2010 was analyzed.
- The highest number of applications was observed in 2002 (7,115), while the lowest was in 1943 (1 application).
- **Trend Insight:** Applications drastically increased after 1952, from 18 applications to 4,626 in 2016.

### Task 03: Analyzing Products
- Products were categorized by dosage form and distribution was analyzed.
- **Most successful dosage forms:**
  - **Tablet; Oral:** Highest with 4,203 approvals in 2002
  - **Injectables; Injection:** Significant growth over the years.
- Yearly trends showed consistent growth in certain dosage forms, with notable increases in injectables.

### Task 04: Exploring Therapeutic Classes and Approval Trends
- **Highest drug approvals by TE_Code:**
  - AB: **57,031 approvals**
  - AP: **24,154 approvals**
- Approvals increased significantly after 1982 (2.9k approvals), peaking in 2002 (5.7k approvals).
- **Most successful sponsor:** ZYDUS PHARMS USA INC had the highest number of approvals post-2005.
- **MarketingStatus segmentation:**
  - 47.89% of products had a status of 3.
  - 46.96% had a status of 1.
- **Most popular dosage form:** Tablet; Oral 5mg

## Recommendations
- **Increase investment and collaborations** with **ZYDUS PHARMS USA INC** as they were the most successful sponsor.
- **Scale production** of **Tablet; Oral 5mg**, the most popular dosage form.
- **Expand production and advertising** for **Injectables; Injection** due to their significant growth.
- **Investigate underperforming forms** like **Soap; Topical** and **Emulsion; Oral**, and explore root causes for their lack of growth.

## Usage
- The dataset can be used for predictive analysis of future drug approval trends.
- Findings can assist pharmaceutical companies in **strategic decision-making** regarding investments and production.
- Further segmentation analysis can help in **marketing and distribution strategies**.
